# Hi there, I'm Shashank Kashyap! 👋
### Bioinformatics | Computational Drug Discovery | Data Science

I am a **Biotechnology Engineering** graduate with a passion for decoding biological complexity using computational tools. My work bridges the gap between **wet-lab biology** and **data science**, focusing on Transcriptomics, Structure-based Drug Design, and Systems Biology.
